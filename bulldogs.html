        <p>The English Bulldog is a small to medium sized animal that is dependable, very sweet, and only needs moderate excercise! </p>
        <p>They are very laid back and low tolerant animals. They rarely ever bark and don't always need lots of attention. However, they do drool often and snore very loudly, so I wouldn't recommend letting them sleep in the bed. </p>
        <p> They are absolutely great with kids. They don't need much excercise, a brief walk and nap on the couch is just about it. They are also the least picky eaters and will eat pretty much anything they are given.</p> <!-- Here is descriptions about English Bulldogs to convince people to want them as pets-->
